un bot hots tout simplement

If you use this, give a star (<3)

To obtain stats from the differents heroes: tap <info "champion">
you will obtain the winrate, the popularity , ban rate, pick rate and match played.

(i tried to put an image but there are some 'problems' so be indulgent, i patch this).



The next step is to give user's stat (winrate, main champions etc..)


Thanks for your read
